        after <a href="bateman.html" class="otherlinks">Patrick Bateman.</a> </p>

    <h3>Why Durden Is Sigma</h3>
    <p>Tyler Durden is a Sigma Male because of his characteristic abilitys. He is two in one and he got a philosophy
        named
        'Hitting the Bottom'. He got nothing except herself and he do not care about life because he got nothing to
        lose. He
        lives in the moment, not tomorrow or yesterday. He just lives for today.</p>

    <h3>How Can I Be Like Durden</h3>
    <p>Like Tyler said'You must lose everything to be free.'. You must hit the bottom for being a Sigma Male. When you
        lose
        everything except yourself you can be a Sigma. After the Bottom you must beat yourslef. You never be alone. Your
        second personalty always fights with your Sigma personalty. Just be your self. After all you cannot be a Sigma
        if
        you got something be able to buy with money. Just sell them for today and be a Sigma Male.</p>
